# GitHub Pages Starter (No-Code)

This folder is ready to publish as a GitHub Pages site.

## Quick steps
1) Create a new repository in **GitHub Desktop** (or on GitHub): e.g., `lm-portfolio` (private or public).
2) Copy these files into the repo.
3) **Commit** in GitHub Desktop (e.g., "Initial site") and **Publish**.
4) On GitHub.com → the repo → **Settings → Pages** → *Build and deployment*:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **(root)**
5) Wait ~1–2 minutes, then open the URL GitHub shows (e.g., `https://username.github.io/lm-portfolio/`).

### Notes
- The site uses a built-in theme via `_config.yml` (`jekyll-theme-cayman`).
- `robots.txt` is set to **block search engines** by default. Delete or edit it when you're ready to be indexed.
- Edit `index.md` and the files in `/projects` to add your content.
