# Example Project

**Summary:** One-liner on the project's purpose and constraints.

**Highlights**
- Material/process: e.g., PETG-CF, stainless, timber
- Key decisions: e.g., switched to 6â€¯mm 2D screen, revised span calc
- Outcome: e.g., reduced install time by 20%

**Images**
Add photos to `/images` and embed like:
`![](/images/example-photo.jpg)`

**Files**
If you want to link a file (e.g., STL, PDF):  
`[Download drawing](/files/example.pdf)` *(you'll need to create the `files/` folder).*

**Notes**
- Settings, calcs, or lessons learned.
